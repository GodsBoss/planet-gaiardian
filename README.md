# Planet Guaiardian

Made for [Ludum Dare #34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/12/09/welcome-to-ludum-dare-34/)!

## The game

You are Omniplant, the Planet Guaiardian. Your purpose is to let a planet's
life grow.

Every planet is its own level. You run around the planet, choose your tool and
use it on the things you come along.

The controls are easy: One button to switch to the next tool in the line,
the other button to use it.

- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/)
